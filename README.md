# 🌟BetterCombinedBag

BetterCombinedBag is a simple and lightweight addon for World of Warcraft (Retail) that enhances the default combined backpack without completely replacing it. It provides you with more control over your bag's appearance and functionality through targeted customizations and quality-of-life improvements.

### ✨ Key Features

This addon extends the default bag interface with several useful features:

**Item Level Display:** Shows the item level of equipable items directly on their icon in your bag.

**Reagent Bag Integration:** Attaches the reagent bag directly to the combined backpack frame, so you only have one single, unified bag window.

**Flexible Column Layout:** You can define the number of item columns (Items per row) to customize the width of your bag to your liking.

**Split Bags:** Provides an option to have each bag start in a new row, regardless of the space left in the previous one, allowing for better visual organization.

**Adjustable Padding:** Allows for precise adjustment of the space between individual items (Item Padding) and the space between the items and the frame border (Border Padding).

### ⚙️ Configuration

All settings can be easily configured through the standard in-game addon options menu:

`Esc` > `Options` > `AddOns` > `BetterCombinedBags`

Here you can:

Adjust the Items per row (columns) using a slider (from 10 to 38).

Fine-tune the Border Padding, Item Padding, and Reagent Bag Padding in pixels.

Toggle Reagent Bag Integration and Split Bags on or off using checkboxes.

This addon is ideal for players who like the look and feel of the default Blizzard UI but want more control and information without installing a complete bag replacement addon.
